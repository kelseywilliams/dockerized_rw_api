            <h2>description</h2>
            <p>kelseywilliams.net api is a lightweight api designed to transfer a small json string with fields data, date, a flag, and an id across the web with a simple request to <code>https://api.kelseywilliams.net/handler.php</code>.  this api is perfect for small projects that don't want to buy web hosting, but still want to get some data to another local network.  supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.</p>
            <h2>documentation</h2>
            <h3>api key specifics</h3>
            <p>all requests should be made to <code>https://api.kelseywilliams.net/handler.php</code><br><br>api key has a standard rate limit of 1 request every second.  exceeding this number of requests will result in a status code of 429 Too Many Requests.  if your key has expired, the api will return 401 Unauthorized.   as of right now, api keys are set to expire after 7 days allowing for a theoretical maximum of 604,800 requests.  an email address can only be used once to create a key.  if a key expires and you would like to create another key please send an email to admin@kelseywilliams.net to request a new key.  this is in order to prevent potential spam as this api is more of a proof of concept and not designed for rigorous use.  perhaps this will change in the future.</p>

            <h3>request: POST (non-indempotent)</h3>
